# Cravings: Foods and Drinks
Cravings is a mod developed by me and my friend p1ague_d0c to add a wide variety of foods and drinks to Minecraft! New crops, new foods, alcohol, you name it! The mod initially started development 6 months ago, and we've only gotten bigger! If you wish to support us, create some pull requests or support us by downloading the mod through our [modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/cravings/). 
# Using the Source
The mod has been developed primarily in [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/), a development software for minecraft mods.

Download [MCreator 2025.2](https://mcreator.net/download), and then download the MCreator plugins [VCS](https://mcreator.net/plugin/97468/remote-workspaces-support-20232) (special thanks to Tucky143) and [Blockstates](https://github.com/MagicalAlexey/Blockstates-plugin-MCreator/tree/2025.2) (im so sorry he didn't compile it ;^;).
Open up the plugins tab, enable java plugins, and add the plugins mentioned above.

Once you've downloaded the source, you can go ahead and restart MCreator. After doing so, go on ahead and click Open Workspace and select the source (make sure to unzip the source if zipped).

And there you go! You can now make your own modifications to MCreator! (Keep in mind MCreator isn't as well optimized as you think, so optimization would require locking every element you want to change.)

## Licensing
Keep in mind that Cravings: Foods and Drinks is under GNU GPLv3 and up.
Make sure you also credit me and p1ague_d0c when using this mod for any modpack!!
